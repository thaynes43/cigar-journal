## Review 1 - Robusto? - 10/18

What a great stick to start my Cuban journey with. Initial notes of Cedar but quickly got a fluffy Almond as I got into it with a bit of fruity zest. The zest evolved into a cherry honey note that followed the cigar down to the nub. No construction or burn issues at all. My cut was great but I over toasted some of the leaf, seems a bit easier to do with Cubans, but I was able to fix that right after I got into it.
