Draw was a little tight but it was an easy fix. Very pleasant from the start. Not much pepper but notes of cedar and flowers. Smoke starts to get creamy into the second third, notes of almond. Enjoying this stick a lot with a late breakfast. Floral notes are gone in the final third but what is left is very tasty. Savory notes like roasted nut and cocoa
