JUN2024 box. Mild spice to start but not pepper, more baking. Almost peanut buttery smoke with a bit of bread. They made this for the French so that’ll be the theme. As the pepper settles a sweet honey begins to mingle with the baguette. Half way in starting to get a bit of a yeasty zest, poppin like a fresh loaf. Turns out the cigar is actually named after a very important French street. The age of this one is definitely showing. It’s good but I think another 6-12 months will really bring out the greatest. The sweet and bready notes are fleeting as the final third burns down. Oak and leather are pretty strong and there’s still that zing of baking pepper on the retrohale.
