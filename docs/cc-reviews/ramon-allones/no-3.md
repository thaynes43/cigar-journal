First garagegar! Starts with a little spice but with that distinctive Cuban flavor mixed in. Notes of black coffee and baking chocolate. Smoke gets creamy rounding the second third. Notes are nutty and sweet, maybe toasted peanuts. The final third is a bit more leathery with a touch of molasses. Wasn’t bad but less impressive than some of the others.
