## Review 1 - FEB25 - 11/05

These are fresh, from FEB25 but I’ve been told they are OK early. Over toasted it cause I can’t see the flame but draw is great and things even out. Starts out fairly mild almost hay but with a nice twang. There is a touch of spice as the smoke exits my nose but it’s ever fleeting. Some sweet chocolate enters the pallet as we round the half way point. Into the second half and the moisture in the smoke gives it a nice creamy texture when exhaled. When held and retrohailed notes of leather and wood pop. It’s worth calling out that the burn has been great and the draw perfect, I’ve been lucky with the construction of the Cubans I’ve tried so far. Chocolate took on a bit of an espresso finish, the final third stayed cool.
