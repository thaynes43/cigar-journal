# Le Hoyo du Depute

## Review 1 - Tiny - 10/29

Box Code: MAR 2023

Hope not ROTT! This is a little Cuban cutie. Packs a bit of a punch right of the bat with spice and pepper. Smoke is plenty and is quickly feeling creamy. Mouth flavor picks up as the first third burns by. Very tasty buttery bread and you can tell it’s Cuban tobacco. Crazy amount of smoke for such a little stick. Pepper is gone and it’s very creamy bready goodness. A hint of sweet is creeping in. Nearing the end it’s worth calling out that the burn has been perfect. This is convenient since a touch up with my torch could be risky. The flavor intensified a bit but the notes remain the same. The sweetness didn’t pick up but I don’t think I’ve ever had anything this buttery. 10/10 for a 45F night but smaller than I’d usually grab.
