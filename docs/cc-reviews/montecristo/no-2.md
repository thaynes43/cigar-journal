## Review 1 - Torpedo - 2025-11-14

Flavorful from the start with cedar notes, nome zest, and creamy smoke. Flavor picks up big time as the first third goes down. Some cocoa sweetness but that distinct Cuban deliciousness is hitting good. Notes on the tongue are great, savory and earthy but hard to put a name to. Some plumb or other less sweet fruit too. Some pepper presents itself on the retrohale of the final third. Espresso and cedar on the tongue.
