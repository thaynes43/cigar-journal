# Double Edmundo

## Review 1 - ?? - 10/26

Cigar over a year old but still very fresh. Cut, draw, and toast went great. Hit with some pepper out of the gate, construction seems spot on. Further in I catch a bit of bread on my tongue with that unique Cuban taste. The cigar starts to open up in the second third with ample velvet smoke. Cedar and cocoa start to creep in as the pepper subsides. Familiar notes often seem offset with something hard to describe. Like buttered bread but from a zesty loaf that hasn’t been invented yet. As the zest begins to fade the cocoa power shifts to a full on dark chocolate spread over savory buttered bread. Velvet smooth smoke draws easily from the cigar. The final third smooths out with creamy smoke that’s still savory with that buttered bread note.
