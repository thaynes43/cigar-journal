Toothy looking cigar. Smoke starts creamy with silky texture and notes of almonds. Distinct Cuban taste that’s starting to evolve into notes of graham crust. There’s a bit of sweetness to it as well, like a honey biscuit. As the cigar burns down past the midpoint the creamy texture starts to switch to leather. Small oil pockets show up on the ash which match the toothyness of this one. Smoked great down to the nub. Mellowed out with a nice oak finish. No burn issues, never once had to course correct it.
