# Serie D No 4

## Review 1 - Robusto - 2025-11-15

Lights up into tons of smoke and some pepper on the nose. Some chocolate sweetness emerges as it burns down a bit with a toasty note of almond. The smoke is now velvety smooth with more sweet notes on the retrohale than pepper. Cigar is into the second third. That distinct Cuban flavor fills my mouth with every puff, I’m going to need to rotate some NWs in so I don’t come to rely on its wonder. The final third looses its sweetness and gets a bit more bitter, like milk chocolate evolving into baking chocolate. This helps the pepper sneak through the retrohale but wrapped in oak and leather. Very pleasant cigar, wonder if I’ve got any boxes of these to age on the way…
