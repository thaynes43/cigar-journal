# 1964 Natural

## Review 1 - ?? - 9/2

Started smooth with some woody pepper notes in retrohale. Sweeter second half, still extremely smooth. Not as sweet as some others Iâ€™ve smoked recently. Lost box shape towards the end but smooth musky finish. Hints of cocoa but not as much as I expected. Recommendation: smoke Maduro soon and the other Natural come spring.
