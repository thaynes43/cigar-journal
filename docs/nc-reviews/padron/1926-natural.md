# 1926 Natural

## Review 1 - ?? - 9/9

After a long stretch of LP this was a nice change up. This was a Belicosco from Pardron which was more of a torpedo than I imagined but a welcome change from the Toros. Spice hit harder than the LPs right off the bat and the smoke was more Smokey and less creamy. Starts to smooth out an inch down with more prominent sweet tobacco. Rounding out the cigar was definitely more mellow than the sweet “desert” LPs I just had. Little sweet, caramel coffee vibe. 9/10
