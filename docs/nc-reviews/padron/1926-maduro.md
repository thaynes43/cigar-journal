## Review 1 - ?? - 9/18

After a long break from a cold it’s time to round out the Padron reviews. I smoked a La Nox the night before this to make sure I was good to go. Out of the gate I’m hit with more pepper than LPs or La Nox. Wonderful start to the burn, nice and even (and I dropped this one so I was worried). Starts to wrap into a nutty spice. Later the nutty pepper starts to Chase a mild sweetness which does not overpower the other notes. Google says this one is for celebrations but I disagree. Certainly not for the yard or golf course but well balanced enough to be in my regular nightly rotation.

V cut this time which worked well with the torpedo-ish vitola. Gonna use the term spice bomb for the initial puffs but with a hint of something delicious. Can taste it more in my mouth at this point, but nutty and more creamy.  Cocoa roars in during the second half. The smell left after each puff is delightful.
