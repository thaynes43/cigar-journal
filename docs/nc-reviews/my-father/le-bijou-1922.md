# Le Bijou 1922

## Review 1 - Churchill - 10/28

I always remember these as pepper bombs but I missed the dried fruit sweetness on the tongue. Pepper certainly does over power the retrohale from the start. The pepper dies down as you’d expect it would but doesn’t exit. The sweetness mellows to a cocoa and coffee notes creep in. More spice, spice bomb for longer than others. Flavors continue to mellow into a pleasant chocolate near the end but the spice still doesn’t quit. The smoke is also getting creamy towards the end, very full.
