## Review 1 - Grand Toro - 9/21

After The Late Hour I wanted to hit the other side of the Davidoff spectrum. Smoke starts off clean and creamy with some toasted bread hitting the tongue. Retrohail is still evolving but I catch some white pepper tingling my noise thats wrapped in cedar. As we enter the second half the complexity ramps up, something savory creeps in. Nutty notes afloat with a bit of earth and hay. It also shares a hidden note I couldnâ€™t place last night that may be truffle. The retrohale continues to be a tease with just a dash of pepper. No overpowering sweet note like a lot of the maduros share. The end of the cigar shifts the a more nutty, less bready note. Very smooth retrohale, more floral than pepper at this point.
