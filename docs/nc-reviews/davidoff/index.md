# Davidoff

[Davidoff](https://us.davidoffgeneva.com/) is unmatched in quality and consistancy. I found most of there Cigars to be enjoyable but some were quite strong. 

If you are just starting to explore their offerings I'd recommend smaller ring gauges. I found that I enjoyed their cigars that had a higher ration of wrapper to filler. The Grand Toro's I tried need to be smoked slowely if you want to make it to the end.
