# Grand Cru

## Review 1 - Toro - 10/5

Went with a V cut and was met with a ton of smoke off the bat. Having it with my morning coffee which is pairing fine now. Woody at the start with a little cracker, mild so far. Some burn issues but I botched the toast cause it’s super bright out and the flame was invisible. Further into the first third there’s a dash of sweetness, like a honey almond glaze on a fresh pastry. Complexity is there but not a mind fuck like The Late Hour. Moving into the second third I pick up the now familiar “Davidoff Earth” note. No wet leaves today though, more like sunrise in a wheat field. Dew still fresh and the air hazy warm. The dew starts to evaporate in the final third bringing in white pepper on the retrohale. Some light coffee notes mix into the earth which brings a change of scenery. That notable Davidoff flavor is still there but is no longer puzzling, it’s now expected. As I smoke more of their offerings I start to appreciate it more and appreciate each one more than the previous. It’s going to be difficult to rank these without smoking each one twice. I thought the Yamasa stole the show but the Grand Cru is impressing me in different ways. I’m sure I missed a lot in my earlier reviews.
