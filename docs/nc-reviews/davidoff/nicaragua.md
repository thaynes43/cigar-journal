# Nicaragua

## Review 1 - Toro - 10/6

Spice bomb at the start but with nice caramel notes on my tongue. The flavor quickly evolves and is quite sweet. Starting to be creamy as well but still bold. Notes of brown sugar in the retrohale and complex earth on the tongue. Some people may say notes from the volcanic ash on the soil but how the hell would you know what that tasted like. As the cigar burns further the complexity continues to impress. Noted of tobacco come in with a little spice. The cigar is stronger than I expected and I need to remind myself to slow down. The finish is clean, slightly spicy, but mostly wood & earth.
