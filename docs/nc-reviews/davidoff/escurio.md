# Escurio

## Review 1 - Toro - 10/14

Peppery zest at the start. Toasted for an easy light with a V cut. Draw perfect as always. A light sweetness blows gently away with the pepper. Davidoff says it’s the “Brazilian Spark”. Bit of a citrus note. Creamier texture in the second third. Powerful cigar, need to slow down. Coffee notes that have a leathery flow. Maybe best described as a nougat pudding. Finish turns earthy and a little less flavorful.
