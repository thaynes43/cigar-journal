Review 1 - Toro -  9/27

After a little break from Davidoff I’m back at it. Starts off very pleasant with an oak body and sweet raisin retrohale. For the second chapter I’m picking up something nutty but the smoke is also becoming more creamy. This combination is leading to a pleasant taste with a wonderful mouth feel. I’m enjoying this more than my first two Davidoff but I think the smaller vitola is helping the most. Cream starts bringing in a bit of leather on my tongue, starting to pick up an earthiness I caught on the other Davidoffs. Some pepper comes in at the end, not creamy anymore. Bit of espresso has taken the place of the sweet raisin.
