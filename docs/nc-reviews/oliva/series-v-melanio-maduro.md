# Series V Melanio Maduro

## Review 1 - ?? - 9/19

This cigar and its Series V siblings are very popular on Reddit. They deserve a side by side session, and all not that, but just got the Melanio Meduro now. I had trouble getting this one going, hit an air pocket plus my cut was off so we needed a couple touch ups. Fortunately I did good and we evened out for photo #1. At this point Iâ€™m getting notes of dried fruit and cinnamon. Deeper in I hit some graham cracker which goes quite well with the other flavors. Photo #2 things started to mellow out to notes of toast and fruit with the cinnamon spice melting away.
