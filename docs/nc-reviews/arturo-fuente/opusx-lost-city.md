# OpusX Lost City

## Review 1 - Toro(?) - 11/1

This cigar has a backstory which drew me in. It starts off leathery and dry with notes of cedar. There is some pepper but subtle instead of the main attraction. Smoke starts turning a bit creamier after the first third. Almond notes come out with a hit of sweetness. Midway through things blend a bit together. Retrohale is less pepper more smooth, maybe oaky. Smoke is thick on my tongue like a molasses coating. As the final third approaches the sweetness is just an echo, melding into notes of dark coffee.
