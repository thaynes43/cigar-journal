# The King Is Dead

## Review 1 - ?? - 10/22

Lit up well with notes of toast and honey. Densely packed and needed a poke from the draw tool. Bit of pepper in the retrohale. Sweetness picks up at the second third and itâ€™s like syrup and caramel. Some of the notes are unique to this session. Bit more savory at the end, but earthy but still a touch of caramel. Aged oak barrels like The Late Hour come to mind. Pleasant finish to a surprising complex cigar.
