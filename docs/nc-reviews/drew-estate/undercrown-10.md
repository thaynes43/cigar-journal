# Undercrown 10

## Review 1 - ?? - 9/4

An alternative to the maduro (which I already have a box of). Spice further in than the other two undercrown. Smooth and sweeter towards the label. Great burn, think Iâ€™m hitting the sweet spot of humidity. 

## Review 2 - ?? - 9/4

Breakfast cigar today. No humidity issues anymore thanks to the 62% jar. Burn starting off great. Tons of smoke. Notes of sweet chocolate, mild spice. Goes well with my chocolate donut and coffee.
