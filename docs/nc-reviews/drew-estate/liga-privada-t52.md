## Review 1 - ?? - 9/7

Two in one day! Though itâ€™s starting off nothing like the Anniversario 10 except for how buttery smooth it is. Swill sweet but more pepper. Anniversario 10 felt more like a treat while this is in between a treat and a meal. No 9 is even less rich so it will be interesting to see how it compares, hopefully soon!
