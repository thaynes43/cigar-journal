# Liga Privada No. 9

## Review 1 - Toro - 9/8

Silky smooth like the others. Little pepper at the start but quickly fills with a touch of chocolate. More balanced than the other two Liga Privada’s but still very full, not for the golf course.

## Review 2 - Toro - 11/9

Went way too long without one of these, was the Davidoffs then Cubans. Little pepper at the start (again) with creamy smoke. Quickly makes its way to a mouthful of dark chocolate, but unsweetened like baking chocolate. Smoking it too fast has been a mistake but it’s cold now, though 50F tonight is a treat from 40F. The chocolate has moved to a dryer espresso and some dry fruit notes emerge. Getting close to the final third.
