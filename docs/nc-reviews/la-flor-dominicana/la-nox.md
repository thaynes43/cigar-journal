# La Nox

## Rview 1 - Toro - 10/31

Subconscious made this my Halloween pick, great choice! It’s starts right off with cocoa notes and creamy smoke. Not much pepper on this stick but it’s there. Might even say some licorice here. The cigar gets smoother as it’s smoked down melding into more chocolate notes with great white ash. Pleasant flavor but I don’t find them perplexing. One of my go to sticks because of how easy I find them to smoke. Dark and oily like a LP No9 but demands less of my attention. Easy to get lost in thought while smoking and forget to update the review…. 100% box worthy. Gets a bit more sweet towards the end. Licorice transforms into dried fruit.
