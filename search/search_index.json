Like buttered bread but from a zesty loaf that hasn\u2019t been invented yet. As the zest begins to fade the cocoa power shifts to a full on dark chocolate spread over savory buttered bread.

Having it with my morning coffee which is pairing fine now. Woody at the start with a little cracker, mild so far. Some burn issues but I botched the toast cause it\u2019s super bright out and the flame was invisible. Further into the first third there\u2019s a dash of sweetness, like a honey almond glaze on a fresh pastry. Complexity is there but not a mind fuck like The Late Hour. Moving into the second third I pick up the now familiar \u201cDavidoff Earth\u201d note. No wet leaves today though, more like sunrise in a wheat field. Dew still fresh and the air hazy warm. The dew starts to evaporate in the final third bringing in white pepper on the retrohale. Some light coffee notes mix into the earth which brings a change of scenery. That notable Davidoff flavor is still there but is no longer puzzling, it\u2019s now expected. As I smoke more of their offerings I start to appreciate it more and appreciate each one more than the previous. It\u2019s going to be difficult to rank these without smoking each one twice.

This combination is leading to a pleasant taste with a wonderful mouth feel. I\u2019m enjoying this more than my first two Davidoff but I think the smaller vitola is helping the most. Cream starts bringing in a bit of leather on my tongue, starting to pick up an earthiness I caught on the other Davidoffs. Some pepper comes in at the end, not creamy anymore.

As we enter the second half the complexity ramps up, something savory creeps in. Nutty notes afloat with a bit of earth and hay. It also shares a hidden note I couldn\u2019t place last night that may be truffle. The retrohale continues to be a tease with just a dash of pepper. No overpowering sweet note like a lot of the maduros share. The end of the cigar shifts the a more nutty, less bready note.

Good cut on this one, burn is almost even. The cigar is beautifully crafted and feels great in my hands. Quickly I\u2019ve realized that this is a complex cigar. Initial notes are hard to place. Creamy, sweet but malty rather than chocolate or fruits, bit of pepper in the retrohail. I catch the oak when I hold the smoke in my mouth. Sophisticated would be my one word description\u2026 I\u2019m a bit over my head with this one. In the 2/3 I\u2019m catching an earthy note with the oak, mainly when I slowly push the smoke out my mouth. Like the oat is now retuning to the earth. A fallen tree. It is as if I\u2019m playing a subtle game with the cigar as it guides me through a late autumn forest. The sun is periodically beaming through the wood offering a malt sweetness. The fallen leaves are damp, oak that will soon be earth. The wind is picking up, crisp and cold pepper that becomes ever more present. The pepper picks up in the final third and the oak is now charred. The creamy smoke at the start is now more powdery like cocoa with charred wood dust.</p>"},{"location":"nc-reviews/davidoff/winston-churchill/","title":"Winston Churchill","text":"<p>Review 1 - Toro - 10/25</p> <p>The last of my batch of 4 packs!

Cedar notes with pepper on the retrohail. Very quickly into it a hint of sweetness wrapped caramel rolls off my tongue but it\u2019s wrapped in that savory earth I catch in Davidoff. The sweet note is more like honey than caramel now and works great withy the fresh earth body. It\u2019s outdoorsy but elegant. The earth and honey has died down now as I burn down towards the final third, getting toasted oak or something of that nature. Maybe some coffee which I am also drinking. The final third tapers down to enjoyable notes of wood and leather with some light spice.
