It\u2019s good but I think another 6-12 months will really bring out the greatest. The sweet and bready notes are fleeting as the final third burns down.

Further into the first third there\u2019s a dash of sweetness, like a honey almond glaze on a fresh pastry. Complexity is there but not a mind fuck like The Late Hour. Moving into the second third I pick up the now familiar \u201cDavidoff Earth\u201d note. No wet leaves today though, more like sunrise in a wheat field. Dew still fresh and the air hazy warm. The dew starts to evaporate in the final third bringing in white pepper on the retrohale. Some light coffee notes mix into the earth which brings a change of scenery. That notable Davidoff flavor is still there but is no longer puzzling, it\u2019s now expected. As I smoke more of their offerings I start to appreciate it more and appreciate each one more than the previous. It\u2019s going to be difficult to rank these without smoking each one twice.

It is as if I\u2019m playing a subtle game with the cigar as it guides me through a late autumn forest. The sun is periodically beaming through the wood offering a malt sweetness. The fallen leaves are damp, oak that will soon be earth. The wind is picking up, crisp and cold pepper that becomes ever more present.

The sweet note is more like honey than caramel now and works great withy the fresh earth body. It\u2019s outdoorsy but elegant. The earth and honey has died down now as I burn down towards the final third, getting toasted oak or something of that nature. Maybe some coffee which I am also drinking.
