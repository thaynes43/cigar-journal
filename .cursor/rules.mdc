# Cigar Journal Management Rules

## Adding a New Brand

### For NC Reviews (Non-Cuban)
1. Create new brand folder: `docs/nc-reviews/[brand-name]/`
2. Create brand index file: `docs/nc-reviews/[brand-name]/index.md`
   ```markdown
   # [Brand Name]
   
   ## Reviews
   
   | Cigar | Number of Reviews | Date First Smoked | Rating |
   |-------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
   | [Cigar Name](cigar-file.md) | 1 | - | 10 |
   ```
3. Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation under "NC Reviews" section:
   ```yaml
   - [Brand Name]:
     - nc-reviews/[brand-name]/index.md
     - [Cigar Name]: nc-reviews/[brand-name]/cigar-file.md
   ```
4. Check `docs/nc-reviews/index.md` - update if needed for new brand listing

### For CC Reviews (Cuban)
1. Create new brand folder: `docs/cc-reviews/[brand-name]/`
2. Create brand index file: `docs/cc-reviews/[brand-name]/index.md` (same format as NC)
3. Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation under "CC Reviews" section
4. Check `docs/cc-reviews/index.md` - update if needed for new brand listing

## Adding a New Cigar Type Under Existing Brand

1. Create cigar file: `docs/[nc-reviews|cc-reviews]/[brand-name]/[cigar-name].md`
   ```markdown
   # [Cigar Name]
   
   Coming Soon
   ```
2. Update brand's `index.md` table to include new cigar row
   - **Number of Reviews**: Set to `1` when creating a new cigar page with a review, or `0` if it's just a placeholder. Increment this number as additional reviews are added to the cigar page.
3. Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation to add cigar under the brand's children
4. Check top-level index files (`docs/nc-reviews/index.md` or `docs/cc-reviews/index.md`) for any needed updates

## File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens for folder names: `my-father/`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for cigar files: `le-bijou-1922.md`
- Keep navigation titles readable: "Le Bijou 1922" (not "le-bijou-1922")

## Navigation Structure
- Brands are expandable sections under NC Reviews or CC Reviews
- Individual cigars are children of their brand
- Always maintain consistent indentation in `mkdocs.yml`
